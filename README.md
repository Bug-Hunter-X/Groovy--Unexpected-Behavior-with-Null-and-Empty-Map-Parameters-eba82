# Groovy: Unexpected Behavior with Null and Empty Map Parameters

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Groovy related to handling null and empty map parameters in methods.  The issue highlights the need for robust parameter validation, especially when dealing with potentially unexpected input types.

## Bug Description
The `myMethod` function demonstrates the issue. While the code explicitly checks for a null parameter, an empty map `[:]` may still result in unexpected behavior within the method body (depending on how the map is used). This scenario highlights the difference between a `null` value and an empty collection, which may not be handled identically.

## Solution
The solution involves more comprehensive parameter validation to check for both `null` and empty maps before proceeding. This ensures that the method handles all possible edge cases correctly.
